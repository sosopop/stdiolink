# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- `src/stdiolink/` contains the core library modules.
- `src/stdiolink/protocol/` holds JSONL protocol plus meta types/validators.
- `src/stdiolink/driver/` is the Driver-side runtime (responders, DriverCore, meta builder/export).
- `src/stdiolink/host/` is the Host-side runtime (Driver wrapper, task/wait_any, meta cache, form generation).
- `src/stdiolink/console/` provides console-mode parsing/responding.
- `src/stdiolink/doc/` contains built-in document generation helpers.
- `src/stdiolink_service/` contains the JS/runtime service executable (engine, bindings, proxy, config).
- `src/stdiolink_server/` contains the server manager runtime (scanner, project/instance/schedule manager, HTTP API).
- `src/driverlab/` contains the GUI testing tool (UI, models, resources).
- `src/drivers/` contains production/sample driver implementations (modbus, 3dvision, etc.).
- `src/demo/` contains demo drivers, host examples, and server manager demo assets.
- `src/tests/` contains unit and integration tests (GoogleTest).
- `tools/` holds developer utilities such as `run-clang-tidy.py`.
- `doc/manual/` is the user/developer manual; `doc/milestone/` tracks implementation milestones.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `build.bat` or `build.bat Release`: configure/build with CMake + Ninja (Windows).
- `./build.sh` or `./build.sh Release`: configure/build with CMake + Ninja (macOS/Linux).
- `./build/bin/stdiolink_tests`: run all tests (Windows binary may be `stdiolink_tests.exe`).
- `python ./tools/run-clang-tidy.py -p build -j 8 -quiet -config-file .clang-tidy`: static analysis.
- `./tools/publish_release.sh --build-dir build --output-dir release`: package compiled artifacts and demo assets into a release directory.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Use Qt types for IO and JSON: `QFile`, `QTextStream`, `QString`, `QJsonObject`, `QJsonArray`.
- Naming: namespaces `lower_case`, classes `CamelCase`, methods `camelBack`, members `m_` prefix.
- Prefer JSONL line-based parsing. On Windows, avoid `fread()` with pipes; use `QTextStream::readLine()`.
- Formatting/linting: follow `.clang-tidy` and `.clang-format` in repo root.

## Testing Guidelines

- Framework: GoogleTest. Tests live in `src/tests/` and follow `test_*.cpp` naming.
- Add unit tests for protocol/meta serialization, validation, and host/driver utilities.
- For `stdiolink_service` changes, add/extend tests covering config validation, JS engine bindings, and proxy/scheduler behavior.
- For `src/stdiolink/host/` request lifecycle changes, add/extend regression tests that cover driver early-exit during `waitNext/waitAnyNext` (see `test_host_driver.cpp`, `test_wait_any.cpp`).
- Prefer focused tests with clear assertions; cover edge cases (invalid input, boundary values).

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Commit style follows Conventional Commits observed in history: `feat: ...`, `docs: ...`.
- Keep commits scoped and descriptive.
- PRs should include a concise summary, testing notes (commands run), and links to relevant issues/design docs if applicable.

## Configuration & Tooling Notes

- Build artifacts land in `build/`.
- Release packages generated by `tools/publish_release.sh` land in `release/` by default.
- Public protocol/meta changes should be aligned with docs under `doc/manual/` and relevant milestone docs under `doc/milestone/`.
- Web dashboard-oriented API backlog is tracked in `doc/todolist.md`; when adding/removing server endpoints, keep this file in sync.


## Skills
A skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.
### Available skills
- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/mengchao/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)
- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/mengchao/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)
### How to use skills
- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.
- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.
- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.
- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):
  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.
  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.
  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.
  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.
  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.
- Coordination and sequencing:
  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.
  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.
- Context hygiene:
  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.
  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.
  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.
- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.
